Blocipedia will allow users to create public and private Markdown-based wikis.

__Purpose:__ Allow users a place to write or collaborate with others on a project. 

__Use-case:__ John is an entrepreneur and blogger.  He wants a semi-private place that only he and his VA can view where he writes his blog posts (his VA edits them), he also notes down ideas of addition blog posts when the ideas comeo to him.  He goes to the wiki and signs up for a free account to test out the service.  He creates his first blog post adds his VA as a collaborator.
